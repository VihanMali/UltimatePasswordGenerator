# Ultimate Password Generator 🔐

Ultimate Password Generator is a Java-based console application that creates passwords based on user input and selected difficulty levels. The program balances **memorability** and **security** by combining words, random symbols, reversals, and character case variations.

## 🚀 Features

- Three password difficulty levels:
  - **Mid** – Simple and readable
  - **Hard but Rememberable** – Reversed words with symbols
  - **Strong** – Reversals + random uppercase letters
- Randomly selected special characters
- Randomized password structure for stronger security
- Easy-to-use command-line interface

2. User enters words that form the base of the password.
3. The program:
   - Inserts random special characters
